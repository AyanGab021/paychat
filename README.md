Dear PayChat,

I'm presenting my examination, and here are two convenient ways to download and run the application:

Download from Google Drive:
You can access the entire file on Google Drive, where I have provided a built APK for direct download.

GitHub:
Alternatively, you can also download the source code from GitHub.

Once you have downloaded either the source code or the APK file, you can run the application. The initial page is the splash page, followed by the landing page where you'll find two buttons for two different exams.

First Exam:
Clicking the "Exam 1" button takes you to the first page, displaying a list of people from the provided JSON file. You can select a person from the list, and upon selection, it leads you to the person's details page.

In the person's details page, you'll find three buttons:

Edit: Modify the information of the selected person.
Delete: Delete the information of the selected user, returning you to the updated list.
Friend List: A floating action button takes you to the friend list of the selected user. Each person in persolist.json has five friends by default. At the bottom of the page, you can add a new friend. A modal will appear, prompting you to input the new friend's information. After clicking "Save," you'll be redirected to the updated list of friends, where you'll find your new friend.
Second Exam:
Clicking the respective button triggers the backend code to generate and display your data info, allowing you to verify if the code is functioning correctly.
